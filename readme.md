# LBRY on the Web

The LBRY experience, in the comfort of your own browser.

Active development is in progress, expect failing tests and breaking changes.

## Running with Docker (if you want to try things)

Make sure you have Docker and docker-compose installed.

1. Run `docker-compose up app` (this will pull and launch SDK and postgres images, which lbryweb requires to operate)
2. `git clone` [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/) repo in a separate folder
3. Run `SDK_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/proxy/ yarn dev:web` in lbry-desktop repo
4. Open http://localhost:8081/ in Chrome

After everything is done launching, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Running off the source (if you want to modify things)

You're still going to need docker / docker-compose for running SDK and DB containers.

1. Run `docker-compose up postgres lbrynet  --no-start` (if this is your first launch)
2. Run `docker-compose start postgres lbrynet` to launch containers
3. Run `go run . serve` to start lbryweb API server
4. `git clone` [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/) repo in a separate folder
5. Run `SDK_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/proxy/ yarn dev:web` in lbry-desktop repo
6. Open http://localhost:8081/ in Chrome

## Testing

Make sure you got `lbrynet` and `postgres` containers running and run `make test`.

## Modifying and building a Docker image

First, make sure you have Go 1.11+

- Ubuntu: https://launchpad.net/~longsleep/+archive/ubuntu/golang-backports or https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu
- OSX: `brew install go`

Then build the binary, create a docker image locally and run off it:

```
make image && docker-compose up app
```
